# refractor

Image optimization AB tool. Allows for lossy image optimizations with human checks while avoiding biases based on specific image technologies.

While there are many different lossless image optimization steps that can be performed automatically, often times lossy image optimizations can be performed on a given image to achieve much smaller resultant images. These, unfortunately, are a very fuzzy thing that can not be automated and are subject to human biases. Refractor's goal is to ease the process of running as many of these optimization steps as possible while avoiding assumptions that may be made about a given format or optimization.

Similar to the process used by optometrists, a given image will be run through a variety of optimization steps, with a human deciding which image provides the optimal rendered quality, leading to the eventual solution of optimized but still without visual degradation.
